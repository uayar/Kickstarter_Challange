The least suitable month was determined to be January with 50% success rate, 45% failure rate, and 5% cancellation rate.

It was also determined that the projects with goals of less than $1000 and projects with goals from $1000 to $4999 have higher chances to succeed with 100% and 73% success rates, 0% and 27% failure rates respectively, and they both have 0% cancellation rate. Please note that the projects with goals of more than $50000 has also a success rate of 100%, however these projects were ruled out due to negligable number of projects launched.
